## How was it made?
The front end is a react web app which also uses react-redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install automatically
You can use this script to install the back- and frontend automatically:
https://gist.github.com/realmayus/42b4de34a21f8b27bf22f3e23038c984
**You WILL need to change the paths of some directories, i.e. everything that begins with /home/realmayus**
The script was made for Ubuntu, so not everything might work out of the box if you use it on another OS.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
